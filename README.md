# MetastasisTracing
Scripts &amp; Notebooks for the analysis of dynamic lineage tracing of lung cancer metastasis.

This repository serves as a common base for all analysis notebooks (stored in the main directory) and the utility scripts (stored in ``utilities``).
Perhaps most useful in the ``utilities`` directory are:
	
	* ``metastasis_score_utils``: functions for scoring metastatic ability. Pertinent functions include *compute_static_metastasis_score* and *compute_dynamic_metastasis_score*.
	* ``metastasis_sim_utils``: functions for simulating metastasis
	* ``validate_trees``: procedures for looking at QC metrics of trees (e.g. the relationship between indel edit distance & phylogenetic distance of all cells)

Each notebook corresponds to a module in our analysis:

	* ``Metastasis_Simulator.ipynb``: simulate metastasis over various tissues and extract out tissue distributions and observed metastatic events.
	* ``Score_Metastasis.ipynb``: filter out clones & score metastatic ability.
